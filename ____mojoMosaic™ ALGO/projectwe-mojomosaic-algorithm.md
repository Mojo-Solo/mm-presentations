# ProjectWE: MojoMosaic™ mojoPi Algorithm for Split-Second Symbiosis

## Core Equation
x + y = z, where:
x = huYman input
y = AI processing
z = Optimal outcome

## Algebraic Expression
z = f(x) + g(y), where:
f(x) = α * x + β * ∇x
g(y) = γ * y + δ * ∫y

α, β, γ, δ = dynamic coefficients adjusted in real-time

## Split-Second Decision Algorithm

```python
def mojoPi_decide(x, context):
    # Phase 1: Instant Reaction (mimicking human intuition)
    instant_z = rapid_neural_network(x)
    
    # Phase 2: Quick Analysis (AI enhancement)
    y = vector_similarity_search(x, context)
    quick_z = deep_learning_model(x, y)
    
    # Phase 3: Synthesis (huYman-AI symbiosis)
    final_z = weighted_combination(instant_z, quick_z)
    
    # Phase 4: Feedback Loop (continuous improvement)
    update_coefficients(x, final_z)
    
    return final_z

def rapid_neural_network(x):
    # Implement using neuromorphic hardware for speed
    return result

def vector_similarity_search(x, context):
    # Use Pinecone for real-time vector search
    return most_relevant_vectors

def deep_learning_model(x, y):
    # Implement using optimized tensor operations
    return enhanced_result

def weighted_combination(a, b):
    # Dynamic weighting based on confidence and context
    return optimal_combination

def update_coefficients(x, z):
    # Real-time adjustment of α, β, γ, δ
    # Uses reinforcement learning for continuous optimization
```

## ProjectWE Wrapper

```python
class ProjectWE:
    def __init__(self, team_context):
        self.team_context = team_context
        self.individual_models = {}
        self.group_synergy_model = SynergyModel()
    
    def process_input(self, individual_id, x):
        if individual_id not in self.individual_models:
            self.individual_models[individual_id] = IndividualModel(individual_id)
        
        individual_z = self.individual_models[individual_id].mojoPi_decide(x, self.team_context)
        group_z = self.group_synergy_model.enhance(individual_z, self.team_context)
        
        self.update_team_context(x, group_z)
        
        return group_z
    
    def update_team_context(self, x, z):
        # Update team context based on input and outcome
        # This affects future decisions, creating a learning loop
```

## Key Features

2. **Adaptive Coefficients**: α, β, γ, δ continuously adjust, balancing huYman intuition and AI precision.

3. **Neuromorphic Computing**: Utilizes brain-inspired hardware for rapid initial responses.

4. **Vector-Based Context**: Employs Pinecone for swift, relevant information retrieval.

5. **Synergy Modeling**: ProjectWE wrapper considers individual and group dynamics.

6. **Continuous Learning**: Real-time updates to models and context for evolving environments.

7. **Ethical Safeguards**: Embedded in the weighted_combination function, ensuring decisions align with predefined ethical standards.

## Application in Corporate/Nonprofit Settings

1. **Agile Project Management**: Instant task prioritization and resource allocation.
2. **Real-Time Meeting Enhancement**: Dynamic agenda adjustment and decision support.
3. **Adaptive Strategy Formulation**: Rapidly evolving strategies based on market changes.
4. **Inclusive Decision Making**: Balancing diverse perspectives with data-driven insights.
5. **Crisis Response**: Split-second decision support in high-pressure situations.
6. **Fundraising Optimization**: Real-time adjustment of pitches and donor interactions.
7. **Volunteer Coordination**: Dynamic matching of volunteers to tasks based on real-time needs.

## Ethical Considerations

- Embedded bias detection in vector searches
- Regular ethical audits of decision outcomes
- Transparent logging of AI contributions to decisions
- User-configurable balance between AI and human input

Remember: ProjectWE with MojoMosaic™ mojoPi aims to enhance, not replace, human decision-making. It's designed to keep pace with the speed of human thought while adding the depth of AI analysis, all within an ethical, team-oriented framework.
