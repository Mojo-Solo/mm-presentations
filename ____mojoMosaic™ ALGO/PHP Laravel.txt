# Simplified Implementation Plan for the mojoMosaicâ„¢ Oracle Agent Executor

## 1. Overview

- **Objective**: Enable non-developers to interact with complex systems using natural language.
- **Approach**: Use AI to interpret user input into commands that execute PHP scripts within the Laravel framework.
- **Focus**: Simplify the system by concentrating on essential components and fostering human + AI collaboration.

## 2. Core Components

1. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - Simple and intuitive input form for users to enter natural language commands.
   - Displays responses and allows for user confirmation or refinement.

2. **Laravel Framework**:
   - Serves as the "magic sauce" tying all components together.
   - Provides routing, controllers, models, and middleware to handle requests and execute business logic.

3. **Command Interpreter**:
   - Parses user input using regex patterns or AI assistance.
   - Maps input to specific PHP command classes.

4. **Command Classes**:
   - PHP classes that encapsulate the logic for each command.
   - Interact with Laravel models and services to perform actions.

5. **Agent Executor**:
   - Orchestrates the overall process.
   - Receives interpreted commands and executes them.

6. **AI Integration**:
   - Assists in interpreting complex or ambiguous user inputs.
   - Suggests possible commands when user input doesn't match predefined patterns.

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Define Command Patterns and Classes

- **Identify Key Actions**:
  - List out all the actions users should be able to perform (e.g., modify slots, generate content).
- **Create Command Classes**:
  - For each action, create a PHP class that extends a base `Command` class.
  - Example:

    ```php
    abstract class Command
    {
        abstract public function execute();
    }

    class ChangeSlotTitleCommand extends Command
    {
        protected $slotName;
        protected $newTitle;

        public function __construct($slotName, $newTitle)
        {
            $this->slotName = $slotName;
            $this->newTitle = $newTitle;
        }

        public function execute()
        {
            // Laravel logic to change the slot title
            $slot = Slot::where('name', $this->slotName)->first();
            if ($slot) {
                $slot->title = $this->newTitle;
                $slot->save();
                return "Slot '{$this->slotName}' title changed to '{$this->newTitle}'.";
            } else {
                return "Slot '{$this->slotName}' not found.";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### Step 2: Implement the Command Interpreter

- **Use PHP for Initial Parsing**:
  - Define regex patterns to match user input to command classes.
  - Example:

    ```php
    class CommandInterpreter
    {
        protected $commandMap = [
            '/^change the title of slot "([^"]+)" to "([^"]+)"$/i' => ChangeSlotTitleCommand::class,
            // Add more command patterns here
        ];

        public function interpret($input)
        {
            foreach ($this->commandMap as $pattern => $commandClass) {
                if (preg_match($pattern, $input, $matches)) {
                    return new $commandClass($matches[1], $matches[2]);
                }
            }
            // If no match, delegate to AI
            return null;
        }
    }
    ```

### Step 3: Integrate AI for Enhanced Interpretation

- **AI Assistance**:
  - When user input doesn't match predefined patterns, use AI to interpret the command.
  - AI generates possible command parameters and suggests them to the user.

- **Human Confirmation**:
  - Present AI's interpretation to the user for confirmation or refinement.
  - Example:

    - **User Input**: "Update slot heading to 'Welcome Banner'"
    - **AI Suggestion**: "Do you want to change the title of slot 'heading' to 'Welcome Banner'?"
    - **User Confirms or Edits**: User confirms or provides corrections.

- **Implementation**:

  ```php
  class AgentExecutor
  {
      public function execute($input)
      {
          $interpreter = new CommandInterpreter();
          $command = $interpreter->interpret($input);

          if ($command) {
              return $command->execute();
          } else {
              // Delegate to AI
              $aiService = new AIService();
              $aiSuggestion = $aiService->interpretCommand($input);

              // Present suggestion to user and get confirmation
              // This could be done via the UI layer
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### Step 4: Develop the User Interface

- **Input Form**:
  - Simple text area or input field for entering commands.
  - Submit button to send the command for processing.

- **Response Display**:
  - Show execution results or AI suggestions.
  - Allow users to confirm or refine AI interpretations.

- **Example (Blade Template)**:

  ```blade
  <form method="POST" action="/execute-command">
      @csrf
      <textarea name="command" placeholder="Enter your command here"></textarea>
      <button type="submit">Execute</button>
  </form>

  @if(session('response'))
      <div>
          {{ session('response') }}
      </div>
  @endif
  ```

### Step 5: Utilize Laravel's Strengths

- **Routing**:
  - Define routes that handle command execution.
  - Example:

    ```php
    Route::post('/execute-command', [AgentExecutorController::class, 'execute']);
    ```

- **Controllers**:
  - `AgentExecutorController` handles incoming requests and coordinates with the `AgentExecutor`.

  ```php
  class AgentExecutorController extends Controller
  {
      public function execute(Request $request)
      {
          $input = $request->input('command');
          $executor = new AgentExecutor();
          $response = $executor->execute($input);

          return redirect()->back()->with('response', $response);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Models and Eloquent ORM**:
  - Use Laravel models to interact with the database.
  - Simplifies data retrieval and manipulation.

## 4. Emphasizing Human + AI Symbiosis

- **AI Contribution (98.6%)**:
  - Handles complex parsing and interpretation of user inputs.
  - Provides suggestions and automates processing.

- **Human Refinement (1.4%)**:
  - Confirms or adjusts AI interpretations.
  - Ensures accuracy and aligns outcomes with user intent.

- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces cognitive load on users.
  - Enhances system efficiency and user satisfaction.

## 5. Simplifying the System

- **Focus on Essential Components**:
  - Implement only what's necessary to achieve the goal.
  - Avoid overcomplicating with unnecessary features.

- **Iterative Development**:
  - Start with core functionalities.
  - Gradually add more commands and AI capabilities based on user feedback.

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Leverage Laravel's caching and optimization features.
  - Ensure the system remains responsive as it scales.

## 6. Conclusion

By combining Laravel's robust features with AI's interpretative capabilities, we create a streamlined system that empowers non-developers to interact with complex functionalities using natural language. This approach honors the human + AI symbiosis, ensuring that while AI handles most of the processing, human input remains vital for refinement and accuracy.
