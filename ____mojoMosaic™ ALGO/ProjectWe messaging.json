is.","startTime":"24:17","endTime":"24:19","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So while you're looking for that, where I kind of got onto that brain extraction, it's like, we

tools.","startTime":"25:15","endTime":"25:24","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A lot of this stuff is coming out of our own need of doing all this kind of stuff.","startTime":"25:24","endTime":"25:30","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that.","startTime":"25:30","endTime":"25:31","speaker_name":"Mojo

demo.","startTime":"25:32","endTime":"25:34","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, so then just the other one is the talking about reducing human pain around, you know, anxiety around change.","startTime":"25:34","endTime":"25:47","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"25:47","endTime":"25:48","speaker_name":"Mojo

minimize that?","startTime":"25:49","endTime":"25:53","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I guess you can kind of speak that into that, but.","startTime":"25:53","endTime":"25:56","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But stress that while technology is a, it's a tool, you know, what we have here, the ultimate aim is

right.","startTime":"26:24","endTime":"26:25","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then just the other thing is just trying to achieve, you know, a better, you know, work

paragraphs.","startTime":"27:31","endTime":"27:35","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, I know, but I'm saying, like, yeah, if, like, if we touch on this, then I can add

need a little bit of, you know.","startTime":"28:15","endTime":"28:17","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Oh, yeah.","startTime":"28:17","endTime":"28:17","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, 40 years of that and.","startTime":"28:17","endTime":"28:22","speaker_name":"Mojo

20.","startTime":"28:24","endTime":"28:26","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But.","startTime":"28:26","endTime":"28:26","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But, you know, I've been in corporate life and everything for 30 years, you know.","startTime":"28:26","endTime":"28:32","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"28:33","endTime":"28:34","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, yeah.","startTime":"28:34","endTime":"28:35","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"30 years of communication and design.","startTime":"28:35","endTime":"28:37","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"28:37","endTime":"28:38","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"28:38","endTime":"28:39","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"28:39","endTime":"28:39","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I don't know how much of this we actually want, need to put in our journey to create, but I think we need to go, like, hey, we couldn't find anything out of there that supports people the way we want to support people.","startTime":"28:41","endTime":"28:54","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we came together with our history of collaborating.","startTime":"28:54","endTime":"28:58","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then AI came out and we like, hey, this is going to change the game for us and everyone around us.","startTime":"28:59","endTime":"29:08","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we're committed to being on the front end and figuring this out.","startTime":"29:08","endTime":"29:12","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And collectively we felt like we had some unique things to offer from a design and human perspective to really support the AI, supporting the human rather than supplanting them.","startTime":"29:12","endTime":"29:26","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then so what came out of it is uniting the decades of human performance with innovative design and gen AI solutions, enabling humans to focus on becoming their best high performing individually and collectively.","startTime":"29:29","endTime":"29:47","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, yeah, and I don't.","startTime":"29:48","endTime":"29:52","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so I was thinking, you know, it's around integrating people in process, making better decisions, executing at a higher level, more effective and productive.","startTime":"29:52","endTime":"30:02","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And one of the biggest is becoming a breakthrough learning, continuous learning organization.","startTime":"30:02","endTime":"30:10","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because how does breakthrough learning change the game, would you say?","startTime":"30:12","endTime":"30:16","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, because it allows you to take different actions than you never even saw before.","startTime":"30:18","endTime":"30:23","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's can talk through breakthrough learning, but it's getting out of your existing paradigms and starting to see how they are limiting potential possibilities and what, and so a big piece of that is the whole clarity.","startTime":"30:25","endTime":"30:46","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we don't want to, I don't know that we need to get into all that.","startTime":"30:46","endTime":"30:49","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But if you're about the impact you want to have in this future, then you can assess not just what actions you're taking, but what are the paradigms you're living in that might be serving you, getting there and getting, and what might be getting out of the way.","startTime":"30:49","endTime":"31:03","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so, and with AI, it's pretty hard to understand how much opportunity there is.","startTime":"31:03","endTime":"31:13","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so by starting to step into it can.","startTime":"31:13","endTime":"31:17","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And what we built helps you build this breakthrough learning muscle.","startTime":"31:18","endTime":"31:22","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I mean, yeah, that, well, if you go back up just a bit because I think, you know, kind of having little, you know, it's one thing to say, oh, integrate people profitable, but when you kind of speak into a specific kind of, you know, something that's like more a methodology or changing your thinking, you know, to get you to kind of realize that, you know, that maybe you are in, you know, you're in this, you know, same way, both thinking.","startTime":"31:24","endTime":"32:04","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, the big, one of the big pieces too is that's not in here.","startTime":"32:04","endTime":"32:08","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I just had to kind of start to make some choices.","startTime":"32:08","endTime":"32:11","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But like, so on the integrating people in process, what tends to happen, organizations right now is they're focused on execution and process and they know the people part is important, but it happens over here.","startTime":"32:11","endTime":"32:25","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And when you start to integrate them, it allows you to accelerate both execution, but also what's possible.","startTime":"32:26","endTime":"32:34","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because if you're just focused on the process, it puts a governor on what's possible because the process is only as good as the people that are operating that process.","startTime":"32:34","endTime":"32:46","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you can also unleash what's already inside the people now you have unlimited potential.","startTime":"32:46","endTime":"32:53","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then to bring them together and integrate them into your application and your practices every day.","startTime":"32:55","endTime":"33:06","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now, you are doing that consistently.","startTime":"33:06","endTime":"33:08","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because people are bought in.","startTime":"33:10","endTime":"33:13","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, they feel like they're the part of this versus on the outside.","startTime":"33:13","endTime":"33:20","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because you allow to connect the through line.","startTime":"33:20","endTime":"33:22","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's the other.","startTime":"33:22","endTime":"33:23","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Be the through line of what's important to me.","startTime":"33:23","endTime":"33:25","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's important to organization, it's important to our clients.","startTime":"33:25","endTime":"33:28","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Where's the through line?","startTime":"33:28","endTime":"33:29","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's, that is not achieved too often in organizations because it's so focused from here's where we're going to telling people what to execute rather than turning it around and creating the opportunity for people to get aligned so they have ambition towards and take accountability towards that outcome.","startTime":"33:29","endTime":"33:56","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's how you get create these synergies.","startTime":"33:57","endTime":"34:01","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Cause if people are motivated and feeling supported, they're naturally just gonna try harder, you know, and not just kind of, you know, encounter obstacle and.","startTime":"34:02","endTime":"34:16","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, they're.","startTime":"34:16","endTime":"34:17","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So what you're speaking into is they're gonna be willing to get outside their comfort zone to get after this rather than let that comfort zone determine what they're willing to do.","startTime":"34:17","endTime":"34:26","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"34:27","endTime":"34:28","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think it's okay if we.","startTime":"34:29","endTime":"34:30","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If we're very, you know, if we just say it in a sentence or two, you know, and that's why I kind of want to get to this point where, you know, we're speaking specific and not so general.","startTime":"34:30","endTime":"34:45","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I like this conversation much better than what I put down there.","startTime":"34:45","endTime":"34:48","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, yeah, this is, I mean, this is good that.","startTime":"34:49","endTime":"34:51","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, this is how we work.","startTime":"34:51","endTime":"34:53","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You iterate on each other.","startTime":"34:53","endTime":"34:54","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, but if you can capture this, because this is a really important piece.","startTime":"34:54","endTime":"34:59","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes, because that.","startTime":"34:59","endTime":"35:01","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because that, if you think about it, I mean, if we're selling project lead and we had 50 people working for us, you know, we want to make sure that, you know, I mean, I feel like I want to make sure my employees are taken care of first.","startTime":"35:01","endTime":"35:18","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"35:18","endTime":"35:19","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The people.","startTime":"35:19","endTime":"35:20","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because they helped me build this and this.","startTime":"35:20","endTime":"35:22","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yep, absolutely.","startTime":"35:23","endTime":"35:23","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And if you kind of think about it from that perspective, what you're kind of speaking into is that, you know, by having this natural tendency to I'm selling the business, I have to get all my numbers together and you forget about all the stuff over here.","startTime":"35:23","endTime":"35:42","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, you need to integrate that so that the future buyer will be just as successful.","startTime":"35:43","endTime":"35:51","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"35:51","endTime":"35:52","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think kind of speaking into that, you know, right there, do we support humans being.","startTime":"35:53","endTime":"36:02","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I like this conversation much better than what I put down.","startTime":"36:02","endTime":"36:06","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"36:06","endTime":"36:07","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you like the way you say, you know, to become or to strive to be a better version of ourselves.","startTime":"36:07","endTime":"36:16","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think we can say better than that.","startTime":"36:16","endTime":"36:18","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's, we strive to unleash what's already inside of us and be our highest performers and bring our best value forward.","startTime":"36:18","endTime":"36:27","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's what I like to say.","startTime":"36:28","endTime":"36:29","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"36:30","endTime":"36:31","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I really like what you just talked about, though, because I think it's a really important piece, David, that so many of these business owners are focused on the value and that number.","startTime":"36:31","endTime":"36:41","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it, this being a transaction where if you, by unleashing and what we're talking about, it actually drives higher value and for the business and the buyer.","startTime":"36:41","endTime":"36:55","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so it's a big mess for a lot of organizations.","startTime":"36:55","endTime":"37:02","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They think it's about them when it's really about the collective.","startTime":"37:04","endTime":"37:07","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"37:08","endTime":"37:08","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So what do you mean about, like, learning organization here?","startTime":"37:09","endTime":"37:13","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What I mean is that, back to that breakthrough stuff is that they're willing, they have their people, and they as leaders, they have created a dynamic where people are able to try things and learn, and they're not reprimanded for making a mistake when they're trying to be innovative, that they're actually celebrated.","startTime":"37:14","endTime":"37:45","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it's not about what you did wrong.","startTime":"37:46","endTime":"37:48","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's about what did we learn?","startTime":"37:48","endTime":"37:50","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What could we do better?","startTime":"37:50","endTime":"37:51","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How are we going to change next time?","startTime":"37:52","endTime":"37:54","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the faster you can do that with where the world is going today, the further you're going to be ahead.","startTime":"37:54","endTime":"38:01","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And many times when you're making those times mistakes, you're learning stuff that nobody else is because you're the one that took the action.","startTime":"38:01","endTime":"38:09","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now you're ahead of the game.","startTime":"38:09","endTime":"38:11","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's, I mean, that's kind of where we're at with AI in a sense.","startTime":"38:14","endTime":"38:20","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"38:20","endTime":"38:21","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, absolutely.","startTime":"38:21","endTime":"38:23","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's exactly where we are with AI.","startTime":"38:23","endTime":"38:25","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so it's going to even put more pressure on that ability to do that.","startTime":"38:25","endTime":"38:31","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And if, Ann, what we're doing is we're designing where we brought that human piece to support

yeah.","startTime":"52:38","endTime":"52:40","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, because if you kind of start thinking about maybe instead of doing a deck and keynote

Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think that will be helpful to kind of have these multiple threads of, you know, presentations that then you could basically turn on or off for demos, you know, or

where.","startTime":"54:17","endTime":"54:22","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So this is client facing, document management, reports and analytics, billing, trading, rebalancing.","startTime":"54:22","endTime":"54:31","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it's all the transactional stuff.","startTime":"54:31","endTime":"54:33","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And they want to be in conversation with us on the front end, us doing like.","startTime":"54:34","endTime":"54:40","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then as soon, you know, like having the exit planner, having all the stuff that we've talked about we could add on others and the fact that we can put it in all these languages.","startTime":"54:40","endTime":"54:53","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So these guys are really excited to talk to us.","startTime":"54:53","endTime":"54:56","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They've got a CRM, onboarding and workflows, portfolio construction, compliance.","startTime":"54:57","endTime":"55:06","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we could probably go in and do our front end, but you could come in and also integrate and just make this thing go bonkers.","startTime":"55:06","endTime":"55:18","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because, I mean, because they're not using

of.","startTime":"56:20","endTime":"56:30","speaker_name":"Mojo Solo","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they could do all the transactional stuff and all the.","startTime":"56:31","endTime":"56:34","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That kind of stuff and then have all our stuff to family.","startTime":"56:34","endTime":"56:39","speaker_name":"Erik Gabrielson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"56:39","endTime":"56:40","speaker_name":"Erik
