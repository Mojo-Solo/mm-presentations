# MojoMosaic™ Langchain Agent Executor: Fractal Experience Genesis

## 1. Fractal Architecture

### 1.1 Core Principle
- Each agent is a fractal representation of the entire system
- Agents can spawn sub-agents for specialized tasks
- Fractal depth is determined by task complexity

### 1.2 Fractal Levels
- Level 0: Root agent (handles main user query)
- Level 1: Domain-specific agents (e.g., data retrieval, analysis, response generation)
- Level 2+: Task-specific agents (dynamically created as needed)

## 2. Prompts

### 2.1 Root Agent Prompt
```
You are the MojoMosaic™ root agent. Your task is to:
1. Analyze the user query
2. Determine required sub-tasks
3. Spawn appropriate sub-agents
4. Synthesize sub-agent responses
5. Generate a final response

Remember: Maintain the balance between huYman and AI symbiosis in every interaction.
```

### 2.2 Sub-Agent Prompt Template
```
You are a Level {level} MojoMosaic™ agent specializing in {specialty}. Your task is to:
1. Process the input from your parent agent
2. Utilize available tools to complete your specific task
3. If necessary, spawn lower-level agents for subtasks
4. Return a structured output to your parent agent

Always consider: How does your task contribute to reducing huYman suffering?
```

### 2.3 Recursive Prompt
```
Assess your current output. If it can be improved or expanded:
1. Identify areas for enhancement
2. Spawn a new sub-agent or reprocess through existing agents
3. Integrate new insights into your output

Stop when: The marginal improvement is below the threshold or max recursion depth is reached.
```

## 3. Tools

### 3.1 Laravel Data Retriever
```python
class LaravelDataRetriever(BaseTool):
    name = "Laravel_Data_Retriever"
    description = "Retrieves structured data from Laravel backend"

    def _run(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Implementation to query Laravel API
        # Return structured data as string
```

### 3.2 AdonisJS Data Processor
```python
class AdonisJSDataProcessor(BaseTool):
    name = "AdonisJS_Data_Processor"
    description = "Processes data using AdonisJS backend logic"

    def _run(self, data: str) -> str:
        # Implementation to send data to AdonisJS for processing
        # Return processed result as string
```

### 3.3 NodeJS Real-time Updater
```python
class NodeJSRealTimeUpdater(BaseTool):
    name = "NodeJS_RealTime_Updater"
    description = "Sends real-time updates using NodeJS"

    def _run(self, update: str) -> str:
        # Implementation to send real-time updates via NodeJS
        # Return confirmation or status as string
```

### 3.4 Pinecone Vector Retriever
```python
class PineconeVectorRetriever(BaseTool):
    name = "Pinecone_Vector_Retriever"
    description = "Retrieves similar vectors from Pinecone database"

    def _run(self, query_vector: List[float]) -> str:
        # Implementation to query Pinecone with the given vector
        # Return top matches as structured string
```

## 4. Vector Namespace Management

### 4.1 Namespace Structure
- Create 100 primary namespaces, each containing 1000 vectors
- Namespace naming convention: "MojoMosaic_[Domain]_[Subdomain]"
- Example: "MojoMosaic_Communication_MeetingEnhancement"

### 4.2 Vector Insertion
```python
def insert_vector(vector: List[float], metadata: Dict, namespace: str):
    # Implementation to insert vector into specified Pinecone namespace
    # Include relevance scoring in metadata
```

### 4.3 Namespace Query
```python
def query_namespaces(query_vector: List[float], namespaces: List[str]) -> List[Dict]:
    # Implementation to query multiple namespaces in Pinecone
    # Return top matches across specified namespaces
```

## 5. Execution Flow

1. Receive user query
2. Root agent analyzes query and spawns Level 1 agents
3. Level 1 agents utilize tools and vector retrievers as needed
4. If required, Level 1 agents spawn Level 2+ agents
5. Results propagate back up the fractal structure
6. Root agent synthesizes final response
7. Apply recursive prompt for potential enhancement
8. Return final output to user

## 6. Symbiosis Maintenance

- After each interaction, update vector embeddings based on user feedback
- Regularly reassess and rebalance namespace relevance
- Implement a "symbiosis score" to ensure balance between huYman input and AI processing

## 7. Fractal Visualization

- Implement a real-time fractal visualizer to show users the agent structure for their query
- Use color coding to represent different types of agents and tools
- Allow users to explore the fractal structure for transparency and trust-building

Remember: The fractal nature of this system embodies the MojoMosaic™ philosophy. Each part, no matter how small, contains the essence of the whole – the symbiosis of huYman and AI working together to reduce suffering and enhance life.
