"""
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the U.S. Bank Freight Payment Solutions Presentation Assistant! I'm here to help you create a tailored presentation for your clients based on their unique needs.

To get started, you have two options:

1. If you'd like to see an example of how I can assist you, I can provide a summary of a sample client's needs (e.g., Polaris). This will give you an idea of the kind of information I can work with.

2. If you already have a specific client in mind, feel free to share their requirements with me. I'll help you match their needs with the relevant topics and slide snippets from our extensive library.

Remember, you can type "/help" at any time during our conversation, and I'll provide you with 3 helpful suggestions on what to do next.

So, would you like to see a sample client summary, or would you prefer to dive right into your specific client's needs? Let me know, and we'll start creating an engaging presentation together!
